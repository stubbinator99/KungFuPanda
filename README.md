# KungFuPanda - NLP Question Answering System

[//]: # (### Overview)
KungFuPanda is a question answering system.  It takes in a reading comprehension story and questions about that story through text files and answers them to the best of its ability.  The system uses many factors, including Cosine Similarity between the question and the story text, Named Entity Recognition, and question and verb typing, to determine the answer.  Over the course of 6 weeks, we achieved a 32% score, marked by the precision and accuracy of the answer given by the system compared to the _expected_ answer.  This was a project for our Natural Language Processing class, programmed in Python, utilizing the Spacy NLP framework.
