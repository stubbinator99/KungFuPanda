NLP Question Answering System

External Resources
------------------
The Spacy python NLP library, including the en_core_web_md model, which was trained on OntoNotes and Common Crawl - https://spacy.io/

Contributions
-------------
* Eric Stubbs: set up git repository, researched chunking and NER tools, researched Spacy library, helped implement Spacy library, researched getting the project working on CADE, worked on limiting answer length.  
* Jonathan Call: researched parsing, chunking, and NER tools, researched NLTK library, helped implement Spacy library, researched getting the project working on CADE, worken on improving question typing.  
* We have each contributed fairly equally to the project so far in terms of time and effort.  We spent upwards of 6 to 7 hours trying to get Spacy and our project working on CADE before Yuan Zhuang was able to post the guide on installing python libraries to a virtual environment for the CADE machines.  

Problems / Limitations
----------------------
There are no problems we can think of at the moment.
